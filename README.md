## Rules of the Game 🃏
Blackjack is a classic card game with simple rules. In this version, you can enjoy the following rules:
- The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.
- The goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.
- Number cards are worth their face value, while face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are worth 10 points.
- An Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the player more.
- The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards.
- If the player gets 21 points (an Ace and a 10-point card) on the initial deal, it's a **Blackjack** and their chip count increases tenfold.
- Each round costs 10 chips, and you start with an initial chip count.
